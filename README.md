# Project completed during week 5 at Prime
While enrolled at Prime Digital Academy, we worked on projects during the week to build on what we were learning. During Week 5, this was a solo-focused project and details are outlined below:

This project is [deployed on Heroku](https://infinite-ridge-17653.herokuapp.com/).

# Angular-Routes-Solo
In this assignment we will be using Angular Routes to display information on 3+ fictional characters of your choice. Your page should have a header and footer of some kind, and 3 buttons to swap out the content of the characters. 

### Sample Characters

* Harry Potter (Harry Potter books/movies)
* Storm (X-Men)
* Frodo (Lord of the Rings)
* Samus Aran (Metroid)
* Indiana Jones (movies)
* Michonne (Walking Dead)

## Content
Feel free to use Google for the content or make up your own! Include some images and give it your best styling effort. 

## Hard Mode
Use `ng-show`, `ng-hide`, or `ng-if` to add some dynamic elements to your views when users click on things.
